<p>When the 70th minute came around in the match, my team was given a penalty. My teammates decided to let me take it. The reason they let me take the penalty was to see if I could achieve my hat-trick. This is often the norm in a football match when a person has 2 goals and need one to complete their hat-trick. It would have been a great achievement for me to score a hat-trick on my first ever football match.</p>
<p>I took the ball and put it on the penalty spot, took about 6 steps back, took a deep breath and cleared my mind and just smashed the ball at the goal. It wasnâ€™t the greatest penalty in the world but because I decided to hit it as hard as I could, it flew past the goalkeeper into the back of the net. I had completed my hat-trick. I then ran off celebrating with my teammates who I was very grateful towards as they let me take the penalty in the first place.</p>
