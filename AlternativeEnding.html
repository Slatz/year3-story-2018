<p>When the 70th minute came around in the match, my team was given a penalty. My teammates decided to let me take it. The reason they let me take the penalty was to see if I could achieve my hat-trick. This is often the norm in a football match when a person has 2 goals and need one to complete their hat-trick. It would have been a great achievement for me to score a hat-trick on my first ever football match.</p>
