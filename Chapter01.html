    <title>My First Football match</title>

    <p>About 3 years ago I played my first competitive football match. As a lover of football all my life, it is strange how it took me so long to play but that’s what happened. My first football match was for my local team, Belclare Celtic. The reason I start playing was because most of my friends were playing for the same team and I thought it would be really fun to play in a team that would be made up of about 80% of lads who are mates away from football. </p>


    <p> Even with that though, everybody that was involved in team was really nice so that made me want to join even more than I already did. I had been training with the team for about 4 weeks before I made my debut. This was to get my fitness up a bit from where it was as it wasn’t up to scratch to play a full 90 minutes. The day of the football match I was going out with the team to be a substitute. On the way out in the car one of my teammates and friends turned to me and said that he thinks I will be starting this match, to which I replied yeah right, as if to say no I will not be.</p>
