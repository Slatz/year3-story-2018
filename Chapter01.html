    <title>My First Football match</title>

    <p>About 3 years ago I played my first competitive football match. As a lover of football all my life, it is strange how it took me so long to play but thatâ€™s what happened. My first football match was for my local team, Belclare Celtic. The reason I start playing was because most of my friends were playing for the same team and I thought it would be really fun to play in a team that would be made up of about 80% of lads who are mates away from football. </p>
