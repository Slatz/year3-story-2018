<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>The match was taking place in St. Anne’s park in Raheny. When we got to the destination, it wasn’t too long before I realised that I would be indeed starting this match as we had not got enough players. As I thought that I wouldn’t be starting I was not fully prepared and ready which is always a bad thing in football as preparation is key. My position was striker. Growing up I always wanted to be a right winger but as I am not the fittest person in the world I adapted to being a striker. When the match kicked off I felt really good being out on the pitch without having one single worry in your head.</p>
