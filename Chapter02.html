<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>The match was taking place in St. Anne’s park in Raheny. When we got to the destination, it wasn’t too long before I realised that I would be indeed starting this match as we had not got enough players. As I thought that I wouldn’t be starting I was not fully prepared and ready which is always a bad thing in football as preparation is key. My position was striker. Growing up I always wanted to be a right winger but as I am not the fittest person in the world I adapted to being a striker. When the match kicked off I felt really good being out on the pitch without having one single worry in your head.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes into the match, one of my friends from away from football crossed the ball to me and I was free in the opposition box on my own. I stuck the football first time but the goalkeeper from the other team jumped down and pushed it away to his right. When I look back on it I feel I should have scored that one but as it was only ten minutes into my first ever football match I think I can be forgiven for not scoring.I was thinking about that chance for a few minutes after it was saved. I was thinking about it because I missed and felt I should have done better. I had to get that chance out of my head as it was playing on my mind. Luckily, playing football, it is easy to get stuff out of your head</p>
