<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>After 20 minutes I latched onto a through pass from one of my friends and cut back, getting away from the defender and then curled a right footed shot into the opposite side that the goalkeeper dived. When it went in I was so happy that it is hard to describe the feeling. When 25 minutes went by I was starting to breathe heavy and get really tired. This was due to the fact that I was really unfit and not fit to play a competitive football match. Another 5 minutes later I was really struggling to keep up with the match. I kept trying my hardest to keep up but when the ball went out of play I was trying to catch a breather and get my breath back.</p>
<p>Five minutes later I was presented with another chance. This time a guy from the team had the ball on the right wing and he got by two people with some lovely skill. He then slid the ball across the penalty box to me and I taped it into the net to make it 2-0 to us. After this goal I was obviously happy again but I was more surprised that I actually scored two goals on my debut.  </p>
