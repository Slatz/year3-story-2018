<p>At half time I was so tired it was unbelievable but because we had no more players I had to continue playing. Ten minutes into the second half, I started to feel less tired and my breath came back. This is what is known in fitness terms as a second wind. This had never happened to me before as I was not the type of person who was really fit back then. </p>
