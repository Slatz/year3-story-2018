<p>At half time I was so tired it was unbelievable but because we had no more players I had to continue playing. Ten minutes into the second half, I started to feel less tired and my breath came back. This is what is known in fitness terms as a second wind. This had never happened to me before as I was not the type of person who was really fit back then. </p>
<p>At around the 70th minute mark our team was awarded a penalty. As I already had 2 goals the guys on my team let me take the penalty. I remember thinking that if I put it in I will have at least a hat trick on my debut. That thought was probably a bad thing as when I took the penalty the goalkeeper guessed the right way and saved my kick. When I look back on it now I think the reason I missed was because I disobeyed a golden rule when taking a penalty “never change your mind and shoot in a different corner to the one you already chose before taking it”.</p>
